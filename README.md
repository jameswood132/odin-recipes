# odin-recipes
This project is for a basic recipe website.

It will focus on utilising the HTML skills I have been learning over the past few sessions on The Odin Project.

It won't look like much but is just a test of my HTML skills. The styling will come later once I have learnt CSS.

I hope to demonstrate:
HTML boilerplate
Headings
Paragraphs
Unordered and ordered lists
Images
Links
